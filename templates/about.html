    <h1>Me?</h1>
    <p>I am nobody. I know a lot, I know so little. I have no credentials, no authority, and nothing I say carries weight. I don't want to shape in else's gaze.</p>

    <p>This blog is a walk through my thoughtsâ€”reflections, fantasies, transference, and associations. Mostly to keep my vestiges alive, to not remain a fleeting door</p>

    <p>Also, I don't know if I'm right, real or wrong. </p>
